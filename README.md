###Purpose
The purpose of this webpage is to provide an online portfolio that provides information about myself, my skills, interests, professional knowledge and a showcase of my work.

###Design
The site has a minimalist design, with limited use of colors combined with striking background images which are intended to capture the user's attention. Text on the page is kept to a minimum to allow the visual images on the page to dominate.

The site has a responsive design, optimised for mobile and desktop users.

###Features
####Hamburger side navbar
The navbar is an important feature of the site as it keeps the page clean and simple. Clicking on the hamburger icon opens the navbar at the left hand side of the page. The hamburger icon is transformed into a cross, which the user can click on to exit the navbar.

####Footer with links to email and social media
The footer is present on each page, and contains links to email and other social media pages. These links open as a new tab in the browser.
